# Image feature extraction
This code is a modification of the code provided at [Cristina Segalins][cristina] website.

Some functions in Matlab were replaced by other functions, and I had to change the syntax for paths to be compatible with Mac OS and UNIX.

The code itself was a collection of code from different sources, the respective licences can be found inside the different folders.

# PsychoFLickr dataset
The code was originally used in research [1] for the extraction of image features from the PsychoFlickr dataset, including 60k images, 200 favorite images for each of the 300 users combined with a BFI (Big Five Inventory) questionnair. This dataset is also available from the site.
